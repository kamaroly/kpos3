## Kamaro Point Of Sale
Affordable, complete platform for running a shop. it manages sales, prints receipts, processes payments,manages inventory, reports, and customers without extra hardware.

## What's new
After 3 years of working on the point of sales system which is built on CodeIgniter, I decided to revamp the entire platform and
build a new platform which is total powered by API. this will allow the total flexibility and extension of the platform .

## Official dicumentation

Documentation for the entire system can be found on the [Kamaro Lambert Website](http://kamaroly.com/support/#/).
